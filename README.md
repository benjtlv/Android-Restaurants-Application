This is the code (Java/XML) of a little android application I made when I was in my master degree's first year.

The purpose is to register restaurants in a database that runs in another android project as a content provider. We have to launch it separatly.

With this application, you can manually enter restaurants, give a grade to it.
You can also locate it on google maps, consult the website, the menu, take a call, add it to your contacts, invite a contact (directly sends a sms through the application), and add a rendez-vous in the android calendar.

I just uploaded the java and xml code. If you want to test it, create two new android projects, and fill it with the code.
